            <p class="card-text">Web development is very much a "professional" kind of programming. 
              Not only is it one of the easier ways to be a freelance coder, it doesn't really lend itself to hobby work. 
              If you want to run a website, you'd probably use a framework like WordPress. 
              Not as many people enjoy making websites just for fun.

            <p class="card-text">The best mobile app developers are those who aren't trying to reinvent the wheel and instead come up with something innovative. 
              So channel your creativity and look for gaps in the market that might offer commercial opportunities. 
              Remember though that the concepts behind your innovations don't have to be overly complex – sometimes the best ideas are the simplest and so seemingly obvious – you may find yourself wondering why nobody has thought of them before.

            <h5 class="card-title">3. Graphic Designing</h5>
              <p class="card-text">Graphic design is a skill. The same as interior design, product design, or automotive design.
                You could consider it as a hobby by choosing to not attend a course or school. 
                You won’t ever be as skilled as those who did choose to study graphic design on a course though. 
                But if it’s just a hobby, that’s fine.
                However, if you’d like to become a professional, then choosing to study graphic design will be required.
                The industry is now oversaturated and undervalued because of all those who think they can become a graphic designer without the skills. 
                Hence possibly why you may believe it’s a hobby, like drawing or painting.
                My key point, as always, is that anyone can learn some software. It’s a tool. 
                But you will only know how to use software. Will you know when and why to use it?
                Just as I could learn to drive a car. 
                That doesn’t make me an F1 driver does it? Mastery of industry standard tools + necessary skills and knowledge = professional.
                Nobody will choose to hire you without demonstrable skills. Skills, process, knowledge, competency, research, and study. It’s your choice.
